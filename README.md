# Autonomous Marketplace Device

The objective of this project is to build a decision making process for a device registered to the Industry Marketplace to automatically choose the best service requests based on matching eCl@ass capabilities.

Please read instructions at https://www.hackster.io/naveenbskumar/autonomous-marketplace-device-adebf3 to setup environment.

The example code which uses the model for decision can be found here: https://github.com/metanav/Marketplace_of_Devices/blob/master/industry-marketplace-python-helper/service_provider.py
